# We Are the DTW New Liberals

When we say Detroit Grit, we are talking about a particular state of mind we embrace here in
southeast Michigan. The Detroit ethos embraces innovation, hard work, and playing fair. Whether you
have lived here for generations or are fresh off the boat, we believe you have a fair shot at living
the good life when you hustle hard.

As the DTW chapter of the center for new liberalism we believe that [new liberal
values](https://cnliberalism.org/overview) are foundational to the Detroit grit that's so essential
to our past and future success.  We advocate for policies and candidates who increase our social,
economic, and environmental prosperity. We remind our neighbors, businesses, and government of the
power of our new liberal values and what we can do to further adopt them. We work to make our metro
happier, healthier, and more dynamic one pragmatic decision at a time.

Please join us! Think of us as a support group to encourage you to get politically involved in your
neighborhood and local politics. We hold monthly virtual meetings to keep up to date with one
another and quarterly in-person meetings to socialize and review our accomplishments. As new
liberals we believe that social diversity, liberal freedoms, markets, and smart regulation are
central to our prosperity. By joining us you gain friends and allies who will help you stay involved
in your community. Join us and help knit the Detroit metropolitan region together according to our
shared values.

Our focus is on making you engaged and motivated in your community, not on our brand. We believe the
metro is large and diverse and each community has its own particular context. By working together
and acknowledging our diversity as well as similarities we can help each other make pragmatic
decisions that that simultaneously benefit our neighborhoods and the region as a whole.

How we work:
