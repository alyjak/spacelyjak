[r] Stats on american lawns, in terms of size [cite], total money
spent [cite], total time spent [cite]. probably should try an break it
out into different sectors (US only) maybe a grid of time zone, and a
north south division as well?

[r] The farm to table movememt is limited in its distribution methods
(boxed veggies, farmers markets) [cite] and its growth is petering out
[cite].

[r] Water usage is becoming more of an issue as the country grows, and due
to climate change. The american lawn is one of the major users [cite].

[r] What are maximal food and resource productivities per acre? Given
a balanced, nutritious and diverse crop which provides yields for many
months.

The business is to provide:

1. a model which recommends placement, land modifications, and plants
   in order to optimize outputs according to the basic features (cost,
   time, water, nutrition, resilience), as well as owner preferences.
2. A network for hooking into the rest of the local community which is
   doing similar things. The model and network support each other --
   obviously increased data driven by the network helps support better
   modeling, but also the model can make the network more effective by
   creating some markets and some specializations. One person grows X
   while the other grows Y and they both benefit. Also people can sell
   their labor and expertise via the network.

   * My ideas for monetization reside on the network. So far those
     include: 1. crop insurance, 2. renting equipment for production,
     or harvest, 3. buying crops for specialized processing (nut crops
     may be a good candidate). 4. Blue Apron type services for home
     veg?


* product 1

Initial version of the model. Need to show that it is data driven,
and results in better production and time management than a naive
basic garden. Objective is to beta test with friends and family, then
roll out as a free, or premium w/o adds, app.

The model may find other customers with some tweaking. Need to decide
whether that is worth the effort.

* product 2

  Add in the network, add in the buying and selling. This is a product
  2 because it requires investment for many of the monetization ideas.

* issues

  market and monetization are hazy at best. Water and time
  management. How unique is this really?

Ten to Twenty Year Vision
#########################

The vision is to achieve a couple things:

1. Better intuitive feel by more urban people about how nature works
2. More efficient guilds, better knowledge of how closed loop
   ecosystems work. This should enable closed loop space/mars based
   crops.
3. More resilient cities and communities. If a community is producing
   a major portion of their own food, they develop some independence
   from the global/national economy. If they can do this while still
   being connected, I believe it will bring us closer to the
   post-scarcity world.

   A follow on to this is that there are many ways to achieve
   post-scarcity. If we isolate humanity from the means of production
   and living, even if we are post-scarcity, that is not ideal and
   promotes very damaging systems of organization and
   government. Citizens should be in control of the means of their own
   health and well-being. This ensures that the world interacts as
   peers, not upper and lower castes.

First Steps
###########

Need to come up with a good software architecture. Brainstorm of
features.

1. Good inputs and reminders to check and inventory things
2. Good use of environment data and plant data (there's links to
   public databases at the back of the Gaia book).
3. Physical and temporal modeling of species. Resilience to adverse
   weather, disease, critters given local (micro) conditions.
4. Ready-made, intuitive procedures, checklists, shopping lists.
5. Ready-made linkages between your own garden and new references,
   blog posts, and other information that may help you out.
6. Intuitive projection of what your land may look and act like given
   an initial crop
