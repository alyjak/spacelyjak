% \lettersection{Introduction}
Early in my career I realized that the context and affordances accessible to an individual can
dramatically impact their decision making capability. Cultivating tools and environments that
improve quality of thought has been my calling ever since. Therefore, Systems Engineering is my
natural home, and I excel at creating environments where systems thinking is spread throughout the
organization rather than extracted into it's own domain of expertise. Although more difficult to
implement, a culture where systems thinking is integrated across the organization results in higher
quality results than if systems analysts were wholly responsible for controlling verification,
requirements, and interfaces throughout the project. It results in empowered and competent teams who
have the skills and tools at their disposal to solve and communicate complex problems wherever those
problems exist -- be it within or between the analytical, manufacturing, and regulatory specialties
responsible for making a complex multi-dimensional engineering effort succeed or fail.

At SpaceX, I coordinated, implemented, and executed projects and activities related to ensuring the
safety and quality of mission-critical software. I developed expertise in a wide range of topics,
including ``hard science'' fields such as aerospace, electrical, and computer engineering, as well
as ``soft science'' fields such as Requirements, Verification, Certification, Safety, Quality, and
Reliability analyses. One of the most important lessons I learned at SpaceX is the importance of
pragmatism and the ability to perform effective product-feature triage. When creating a product, it
is more important to plan on continuous improvement from the onset than to assume perfection. The
fastest way to improve, both personally and product-wise, is to keep executing. Post-SpaceX, I have
used my experience to design and implement engineering coordination systems, including a continuous
integration platform for Raytheon, and a production workflow platform for my last salaried employer,
H3D. Presently, I am developing a Production Lifecycle Management application that integrates
digital procedures with automation and digital sensing.

In closing, my background, skills, and motivations are well suited to helping Commonwealth Fusion
Systems succeed. I, and my family, are enthusiastic about the opportunity to join you. Thank you for
reviewing my application and I hope to hear from you soon.

%% Early in my career I realized that the context and affordances accessible to an individual

%% plays an especially important role in enhancing and improving decision making quality and agency. By

%% would otherwise be impossible. Ansys' mission to provide engineers and scientists with the physical
%% simulation capabilities they need aligns well with my interests and motivations. My background in
%% aerospace, systems engineering, software, and small business gives me the skill set to excel as an
%% Ansys Technical Account Manager. I believe that my skills, interests, and experience could be a
%% valuable asset to the company and its clients.

%% Verses.ai coverletter

%% Early in my career I realized that a person's decision making quality can be improved by changing
%% their environment. Helping to create environments that improve the quality of thought has been my
%% calling ever since. Now that I have children, this interest has grown and blossomed. I am no longer solely
%% focused on workplace environments but rather on what interventions might help individuals
%% society-wide. I am enthusiastic about the mission of Verses, and I believe that my skills,
%% interests, and experience could be a valuable asset to the company.

%% As you can see from my résumé, my experience is fairly diverse yet shares a common theme -- my
%% projects involve designing systems to improve decision-making. I have worked as a team as well as
%% independently to design, implement, and validate projects of various scales. I am keenly interested
%% in how to design environments in order to encourage effective coordination and high quality decision
%% making.

%% At SpaceX, I coordinated, implemented, and executed projects and activities related to ensuring the
%% safety and quality of mission-critical software. I developed expertise in a wide range of topics,
%% including ``hard science'' fields such as aerospace, electrical, and computer engineering, as well
%% as ``soft science'' fields. One of the most important lessons I learned at SpaceX is the importance
%% of pragmatism and the ability to perform effective product-feature triage. When creating a product,
%% it is much more to plan on continuous improvement than on perfection. The fastest way to improve,
%% both personally and product-wise, is to keep executing. Post-SpaceX, I have used my experience to
%% design and implement engineering coordination systems, including a continuous integration platform
%% for Raytheon, and a production workflow platform for my last salaried employer, H3D. Presently, I am
%% developing a Production Lifecycle Management application that shares a similar vision to that
%% espoused by Verses through products such as KOSM that are oriented towards inclusive collaboration
%% between artificial and human systems. Verses interest in sense-making, distributed intelligence, and
%% first-principles R\&D and engineering resonates strongly with my interests.

%% I would also like to note that my wife, Dr. Brandalyn Riedel, has provided me with a range of skills
%% I would otherwise not have had the opportunity to develop. Not only has her background in psychology
%% and her PhD in Neuroscience deepened my understanding of what works and what doesn't with respect to
%% the mind and learning, but I have also been able to collaborate with her on statistics and machine
%% learning problems. This skillset will prove useful for work at Verses.

%% In closing, my background, skills, and motivations seem well suited to helping Verses succeed. I,
%% and my family, are enthusiastic about the opportunity to join you in your quest to reimagine the
%% relationship between AGI/ASI technologies and humanity through leveraging lessons from physics-based
%% first principles while staying grounded in ethics. I have submitted my application for more than one
%% job posting, as I believe I could excel in a few different positions. Thank you for reviewing my
%% application and I hope to hear from you soon.
