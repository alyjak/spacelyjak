NOTES

Grandma was a very deliberate person. In this she died exactly how she lived: on her own terms. She was fiercely independent, living on her own even at the age of 92. And when finally she was unable to care for herself, she said her final goodbyes and that was that. Like I said, my grandma was very deliberate.

When my brother and I sat down to write this memorial we realized that for us, our memories of her are not so much formed around specific stories or events, but rather are about the rituals and moments of clarity she shaped around us.

When we look back on our time with her we'll remember our visits with her in summertime. Her lush gardens, each unique flower garden stretching around the property. The big vegetable garden was the centerpiece of the back yard with its great bean poles and deer fence.

We'll remember her raspberry patch and all the berries we pilfered while supposedly helping her with the harvest. Those amazing desserts she provided us hot out of the oven.

We'll remember the kitchen, in which she cooked delicious multi course meals every-time we visited; the after-dinner Scrabble games. Grandma was always competitive, she didn't go easy on us and got tremendous joy from trouncing us game after game, but she  played fair.

From her we learned that it's not about the words we speak but what you do and how you live that really counts.

Grandma, I will keep your memory alive by remembering your caring strength, and when times are not so hot or we need to pull together, we will be there with a quiet direction and deliberate pace. I can only hope that when the time comes I too will have the courage to leave this earth on my own terms.



Farewell Grandma,
We love you
