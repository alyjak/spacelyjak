:   Normative Dynamical Systems Theory, introduced in (@normativity) supposes a definition of
    normative behavior grounded in the requirements of autopoiesis. NDST demonstrates how some type
    of normativity is evolutionarily nececessary. The paper proports to:

    > to build up to a physicalist conception of cognitive normativity. A physicalist conception of
    > cognitive normativity (1) must specify the normativity that is inherent to cognitive systems
    > and the processes thereof, and (2) it must demonstrate how cognitive systems are able to
    > autonomously achieve these norms.  We suggest that both (1) and (2) can be achieved by the
    > theory of autopoiesis.

    The reference concept for NDST is autopoiesis. NDST introduces an analytical structure for
    determining what is and what is not autopoietic:

    > Before we move on to explicate the conditions of our physicalist theory of cognitive
    > normativity, we need to be clear about what we mean by "autopoiesis". To do this, we offer a
    > broad DST schematic for autopoietic systems: NDST.
    >
    > DST represents a physical system via seven steps. [Figure 2](#ndst-schematic) illustrates the
    > product of all seven steps in a two-dimensional phase space (for simplicity, not necessity).
    > The first step is to construct a phase space from variables in the system. In NDST, the phase
    > space must be constructed from non-normative variables so as to avoid presuming normativity
    > when defining the grounding for it (i.e., autopoiesis).
    >
    > The second step is to identify the subspace of the phase space that consists of points in
    > which the autopoietic system maintains its structural requirements. Let that subspace be
    > $S1$. Let the complementary subspace be $S2$. $S2$ consists of the points in which the
    > autopoietic system does not maintain its structural requirements. For example, some of those
    > points are thermodynamic equilibria. While non-autopoietic systems tend toward thermodynamic
    > equilibria (e.g., a pendulum eventually comes to rest in the bottom of its arc), autopoietic
    > systems intelligently avoid thermodynamic equilibria (and everywhere else in $S2$) by
    > maintaining their coupling in $S1$ (e.g., a "living" pendulum that could avoid resting in the
    > bottom of its arc by strategically using energy sources from its environment).

    > The next steps represent the autopoietic system's goal-oriented behavior, which consists of an
    > initial state, operators, path constraints, and goal states (Newell & Simon, 1972). The third
    > step is to plot the initial state of the system, $IS$, which is *usually* in $S1$ for
    > autopoietic systems. Following the enactivist terminology, we could say that the autopoietic
    > system is "dynamically coupled" to its environment at $IS$. By the seventh step, we will have
    > a definition for a *normative* dynamical coupling between the system and its environment.
    >
    > The fourth step is to construct the set of all connected paths of a given length (which is
    > limited by each path's horizon of predictability for the modeler, who can be related to the
    > model as a third-person or a first-person).  These paths will fill a neighborhood (in the
    > topological sense) around $IS$. These paths ought to be understood as the change in the phase
    > space variables that results from a series of agent-enacted **operators** and the
    > environment's response.
    >
    > The fifth step is to eliminate some of the paths in that set by subjecting the set to a set of
    > **path constraints** (e.g., the laws of physics). Once again, these path constraints must be
    > non-normative so that we can define normativity in DST without circularity concerns. Let $P$
    > be the set of all connected paths of given lengths that comply with path constraints. Any path
    > in $P$ is a course of action that the autopoietic system could take.
    >
    > The sixth step is to plot points at the end of every path in $P$ (i.e., on each path's horizon
    > of predictability). Let $GS_i$ be the endpoint of each path $i$. After all, if the autopoietic
    > system were to take path $i$, then $GS_i$ would be the goal state for the autopoietic
    > system. So far, though, we have not yet represented autopoiesis.
    >
    > The seventh and final step in constructing NDST introduces normativity by partitioning $P$
    > into $P1$, which consists of any path $i$, if $GS_i$ is in $S1$, and into $P2$, which consists
    > of any path $j$, if $GS_j$ is in $S2$. An autopoietic (and, thus, normative) system
    > constitutively selects its paths from $S1$ and so functions in a way that sustains and even
    > promotes its structure and function (Thompson, 2007). As long as the system remains in $S1$,
    > we say that it is "normatively coupled" to its environment. But if the system enters $S2$,
    > then it becomes "naturally coupled".
    >
    > The distinction between natural and normative coupling is useful because it implies that if
    > normative coupling is lost, then the system's development will subsequently tend toward
    > thermodynamic equilibrium. This is necessarily the case because all open physical systems
    > (including biological and cognitive systems) are subject to the law of entropy, and
    > autopoietic systems are able to preserve their structural-functional identity only when they
    > are in $S1$ (i.e., normatively coupled). Thus, when an autopoietic system loses normative
    > coupling, it must regulate its responses to the environment in a way as to "promote" itself
    > back to $S1$, so as to maintain its autopoietic identity.
    >
    > On this definition of autopoiesis, the functional aspect of autopoiesis (i.e., the system's
    > "aims") is its ability to engage in self-promotion. Self-promotion is necessarily a normative
    > process, because the autopoietic system constitutively treats its phase space as a problem
    > space with positive and negative valences. What counts as relevant for the system is any path
    > $i$, whose $GS_i$ is in $S1$, since any such path will constitutively promote the system into
    > a state of normative coupling, when enacted. On the contrary, any path $j$, whose $GS_j$ is in
    > $S2$, will necessarily be deemed *irrelevant* (to autopoiesis), since it will instead
    > constitutively demote the system into a state of natural coupling.
    >
    > We have basically defined the functional aspect of autopoiesis as problem-solving. The
    > proposed definition of autopoiesis is warranted because the autopoietic system is
    > constitutively aimed at solving the ongoing problem of finding and enacting some path in $P1$
    > (which, together with $P2$, forms the problem space). Solving this problem in time $t$
    > achieves a structural-functional state in the next moment, $t' > t$, that is also
    > constitutively autopoietic. As time passes from $t$ to $t'$, the phase space changes
    > accordingly, and so do the requirements for structural self-sustainment from $P1$ at $t$ to
    > $P1$ at $t'$. This simply means that what is relevant for the system changes according to
    > changes in its problem space.  Accordingly, the process of autopoiesis terminates once a
    > system has lost its autopoietic identity and is, therefore, no longer constitutively aimed at
    > self-reproduction via self-promotion.
