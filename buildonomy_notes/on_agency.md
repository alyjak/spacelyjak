## Why Act?

Why act? I ask this question pragmatically -- not ontologically. I don't want to explore universal
truths about the nature of reality. Instead, I will take objective and subjective realities as
givens, then explore what drives me, as a subjective being, to act in an objective reality that's
beyond my full comprehension. If we can reach some (partially) satisfactory answer to why act, a
natural follow on question is *how* to act, exploring this question will form the bulk of our time
together.

Lets start with givens. These are my own definitions. I don't think they are too controversial
regardless of what ontology you hold as truth, and I hope you think so too.

*I* am defined by my unique [Subjective Environment][][^1]. My subjective environment is a stream of
information embedded within a subset of [Objective Reality][], my [Contextual
Environment][]. Objective reality is an infinite stream of ever-changing phenomena of which I am
just a single blip. Moment to moment, who *I* am changes because the information content of my
subjective experience changes. Within my subjective experience, I have ever-changing [value][]s,
[intention][]s, [attention][], and [Sensory Input][]s.

Why I act is then simply because my attention processes sensory inputs from which I determine some
aspect of objective reality does not align with my values. I then formulate intentions, by which I
command [effector][]s, thereby disturbing objective reality in a manner which I predict will bring
my subjective and objective realities closer to alignment. These characteristics: sensory-input,
attention, values, intention, and effectors characterize my [agency][]. It is through my agency that
I manipulate objective reality in a manner that is not predictable from elemantary laws of nature.

This answers the question why *I* act mechanistically, but doesn't leave me with much from a
pragmatic standpoint. It does provide a new "given" from which to further frame the question though:
"Given I act in an attempt to align my contextual environment with my values, why act?", or in other
words, "why have values out of alignment with my contextual environment?". This is a purely
philosophical question, which I do not intend to answer, but I will direct you to The Ethics of
Ambiguity [@ETHICS], and Finite and Infinite Games [@FIG], both of which I believe present a
compelling analysis of this question. Instead, I will give you my personal take. Why Act? Because an
objective reality formed and changed by a diversity of different subjective beings with different
values is an infinitely more interesting place than one in which such beings are not acting.

This rudimentary theory of mind lays the foundations I need to proceed. To summarize, as a
subjective being, I act because my contextual-environment is not aligned with my values. Therefore,
if I desire to act skillfully and not instinctually, I must improve the quality of my sensory input,
attention, values, intention, and effectors. Are there methods to improve these qualities of my
subjective experience? The Animist Interface is one such method.

[^1]: First usage of key terms will by hyperlinked to their definitions within the [Glossary][].

## Form an Intentional Relationship with Reality

The universe is full of phenomena that I do not understand. This is just as true for my direct
experiences as it is of my relationship to the universe at large. Indeed, every thought, action, and
sensation I experience trickles through uncountable causes before entering my perception. It is only
the lightest surface of existence which passes through my consciousness. There is a fathomless ocean
of proximate causes supporting whatever phenomena I claim to understand. Because I am embodied and
my life is finite, there are fundamental limits to what I can know and do. What then, am I to do if
I have values and I desire to change my environment to better reflect those values? Do I have any
hope of success?

What is my relationship with the contextual web of cause and effect that determines my environment?
Is it healthy?  By environment I mean my local context within the universe at large. How I relate to
the forces which influence me, and whom I influence in turn, has a lot to say about the quality of
my personal subjectivity as well as the qualities I bring to our shared experience.

How should I relate to my environment when my baseline assumption is it will remain fundamentally
mysterious to me? To start, I must recognize my subjectivity. As a subjective being, what does the
universe mean to me?  My universe is different than yours, as my experience is filtered through my
personal subjectivity. Additionally my subjective universe evolves differently than yours, for even
if you and I shared the same objective sensory stream, it would affect and change our minds
differently, due to the generative engines of our imagination and intrinsic randomness of the
universe.

In order to establish a reasonable framework for relating to my experience that works for you as
well, I must make some reasonable inferences as to what characteristics we likely share. I can infer
there are objective phenomena, and an objective environment within which my subjectivity is
embedded, and I can infer there are other persons within this shared objective environment. If I
want to reflect my subjective values into the universe, I must be able to live those values within
my subjective universe as well as work to change my objective environment to better reflect them.

As a human being with a baseline understanding of evolution (as is understood in the early twenty
first century), I can infer that my subjective experience "runs" on "hardware" that has evolved over
millennia. This hardware evolved based on my ancestors contextual relationship with their
environments. Most recently, these ancestors lived and thrived in social groups. As such, their
lives hinged on their ability to form and foster relationships internal and external to their
tribe. Much of what makes me *me* is based on Homo Sapiens capacity to interact and cooperate
together. It is likely that my hardware is optimized to perform well with modeling and navigating
social relationships.

Social relationships introduce a layer of nuance and complexity missing from many other
phenomena. Interacting with another person involves interpreting intentions, moods, and
actions. Each action may be laced with multiple layers of meaning. Person-to-person interaction is a
forcing function for my internal processes to be more systematic when modeling and predicting of the
world around me. People change, often in dramatic ways, day to day and even moment to moment. To
successfully interact with another person, I must be able to predict how they are feeling and how
they are likely to act. This capacity for high-fidelity internal modeling, which is required for
healthy social relationships, is also beneficial in other circumstances, as it encourages me to
explore possible consequences of my actions more holistically than I would otherwise.

Social interaction requires empathy and comfort with uncertainty. No two people are alike. This
becomes readily apparent when I observe my relationships with my friends and loved ones. I form
healthy relationships when I value how my friends are different from myself. Even though I cannot
fully comprehend what it is like to be my friend, I trust them to care for and look out me, just as
I look out and care for them. A dichotomy exists within such a relationship, for on one hand, my
friend and I know one another well enough to have a nuanced model of each others likes, desires, and
other motivations, yet we also do not reduce each other to the caricatures of one another we each
naturally carry around in our minds. We trust and welcome the ambiguity that's central to our
relationship as two subjective beings. This characteristic of trying to predict a loved one's
behavior while simultaneously welcoming surprise and novelty in the relationship is intimacy itself,
and offers an excellent framework for relating to the universe at large.

Communication is a unique form of action required for social interaction. When communicating, I act
in order to intentionally produce a change within the subjective environment of sources of agency
other than myself. When I know another agent is communicating to me, I also have knowledge of their
intention to update my contextual environment. With this knowledge I can further interpret their
intention beyond the basic sensory input they provide me with. Depending on our relationship, I can
infer harmful, beneficial, or neutral intention and thereby either block or facilitate receipt of
their message.

So, when interacting in a social context, I am comfortable with uncertainty in a manner that's
functionally different than when I interact within an environment I take to be inanimate.  That is,
an environment without its own embedded subjectivity. As a species, we seem to get into the most
trouble when we over simplify the world. In short, when we objectify our environment. For example:

> Treating the natural world as a reservoir of extractable resources rather than as members of our
> extended family as well as our means of survival.

> Treating ourselves (or our coworkers) as automatons we can drive to greater productivity, instead
> of as wellsprings of creation and unique irreplaceable subjective universes onto themselves.

> Treating our information technologies as simple machines, and not as modes of communication, which
> have corresponding benefits and dangers due to their capacity to influence our subjective
> environment.

What I hope to show is that by relating to experience inter-subjectively, my ability to positively
influence my subjective and objective environments is maximized. I interact with my environment as a
shared community, wherein I must develop relationships, and wherein every sense object and every
action may communicate something. If I instead relate to my environment objectively, there would be
little stopping me from relating to objective reality as I relate to a piñata, as a *thing* created
to bash up and extract the candy from inside. By fostering relationships, I can form coalitions and
thereby maximize the influence my agency can extend into our shared environment.

This is The Animist Interface. An interface I install within my own mind in order to improve my
relationship with all the phenomena I encounter by becoming more intentional with my
communication. By relating to my environment with a baseline assumption that I am interacting with
entities with their own subjective experience, I can change my behavior to relate to this
fundamental experience of "not knowing" in a positive manner.

So what does it mean, in a general sense, to relate to the universe socially rather than
objectively? What sort of relationships should I foster and how should I foster them? This is the
subject matter I want to discuss. In the following chapters I will address specific issues related
to this question, but to start off, I will outline the principles that lie at the heart of this
framework, agency as a force of nature, models of aggregate agency, and agency as a property of
network topology.

(@) Suggests an ecosystem, predisposing action to encourage systems thinking and value diversity.
(@) Encourages recognition and prediction of downstream consequences.
(@) Encapsulates natural, technological, and social forces within a common framework.
(@) Improves communication capacity.


## Agency as Force of Nature

In order to foster a social relationship with my subjective universe, I must have a social
understanding of my subjectivity. The Animist Interface provides a framework for interpreting
interactions as relationships. This framework relies on modeling the phenomena I interact with as
causally related to the actions of subjective agents.

In this manner, I prime myself to make inferences about who benefits from what. I can then reason
about intentions that (may have) predisposed an agent to take actions which lead to the phenomena I
observe. Here I have primed myself to take an observation and predict what sources of agency might
be behind the phenomena. This improves my capacity for agency in three ways:

First, it simplifies the complexity of my environment, stripping away intermediaries and leaving
behind a model of influence and intention. With intermediate physical forces removed, I'm left with
a map of where to focus my attention in order to preserve my subjectivity and influence my
environment according to my values.

Second, as mentioned before, it models the universe into a language my brain is likely optimized to
process. This enables me to use my natural capacities to their fullest extent.

Third, by mapping causal relationships to models of intention and agency, I can hypothesize social
structures such as coalitions and competing influences which may be linked to my observations. In
this manner, I begin to reason about aggregate sources of agency. Through concepts of aggregate
agency, I can then start reasoning about the sources of my internal values, intentions, and
attention. I can also start to reason about super-agent structures such as ecosystems, families,
tribes, nations, and corporations. Such structures are rich in terms of their behavior. Their
attention, intention, sensing and effecting apparatus are defined through a coherence function
applied to the capacities of their constituent sub-agents. By modeling such structures as agents
unto themselves, I can form intentional relationships with them, thereby facilitating my capacity to
understand and influence their behavior.

In short, by observing my environment through The Animist Interface I start to view my experience as
a dialogue between my subjectivity and inter-subjective -reality. Because social intentions are
composable (via aggregate sources of agency), I have a unifying framework within which to plan and
predict the evolution of my contextual environment.

(@) Treat agency as a composable force:

    `attention(sensing) * intention(effecting) -> action`
(@) Predict/Infer values/intentions/goals for internal and external sources of agency.
(@) Examine convergency/divergency between sources of agency and strategize methods of alignment with personal values
(@) Composable such that we can enhance our thinking through integration with technology

## Aggregate Agency

To envelop my subjective universe with a relational and social interface I must become proficient at
identifying four traits within each moment; What subjectivity do *I* identify with? What
subjectivit(ies) I am communicating with?, and what language(s) am I interpreting? What language(s)
am I communicating with?

I know I have the capability of holding conflicting values, plans, and opinions at the same time. If
I start viewing myself as a collection of separate entities, each with their own desires and
priorities, I can create intentional relationships with my sources of internal conflict and start to
better identify where my values come from. By identifying separate values within myself and
prescribing subjectivity to them, I begin an internal dialogue, through which I can understand
myself better and open previously locked doors of reconciliation and harmony.

[Inter-Subjective Relationship][]s are dialogues between peers. They consist of the "normal" types
of relationships between people, but can also exist between sub-agents and between super-agents. An
example of such relationships is between nations, where they communicate through diplomacy, trade,
tourism, migration, and even war.

[Intra-Subjective Relationship][]s are where we start to see how our social minds start to
turbocharge our capabilities as individuals. This tribe of [Spirit][]s within myself consists of two
main categories of agent. There can be [Sub-Agent][]s and [Super-Agent][]s. Sub-agents are the
spirits who's values and desires are clearly a subset of my own, such as my agents of
self-preservation who help take care of my body. Super-agents are manifestations of various external
environments I consider myself to be part of, such as my family, career, government, religion, and
the geography I consider home.

Each member of my intra-subjective tribe forms some aspect of who I am at this moment, and as the
tribe and its relationships change, I change. By intentionally communicating with my internal forces
of agency, I can begin to harmonize my internal values, encouraging some forces to flourish and
others to wither based on their alignment with what I consider to be my personal values.

I can also start to see how my relationship with super-agents doesn't have to be so one-sided. Once
I start to identify their subjective boundaries, their values, intentions, and attention then I can
start to see how to communicate and thereby influence them more effectively.

Forming relationships within my subjective environment sounds like a recipe for psychosis, but may
actually help improve my sense of well-being. This is a lesson from Buddhism, which teaches that by
training the mind to remove identification with a *self* that's fully in control, my capacity as a
well-balanced and functional individual is actually increased. By relating to the various drives and
desires within me socially I can, in a sense, start to observe them externally instead of just
feeling them internally. This gives me the perspective necessary to watch them change over
time. When I can relate to enough systems within myself this way, I'm left without any concept of
*me* outside of these relationships. As is practiced in Buddhism, when the concept of self is
dissolved in this manner, many types of suffering are also dissolved.

(@) Encapsulate phenomena within subjective as well objective environments
(@) Delineate and identify the separate forces which push and pull your intentions.
(@) What are you a sub agent of?
(@) Relate more skillfully to the impermanence of our embodied existence.

### Classifying Types of Aggregate Agency

Defining a single agent and its characteristics through analyzing its constituent sub-agents

An aggregate agent is a hierarchical agency network. The network is composed of the following
subgraphs. Characteristics of the aggregate can be predicted/inferred by measuring/predicting these
subgraphs.


Market

:   Sub-agents are loosely coupled with one another by sharing signals from interacting with one or
    more shared scarce resources.

Conductor

:   Sub-agents share signals which directs and synchronizes their attention

Executor

:   Sub-agents share effector(s) to synchronize their action. Effectors use different
    voting/weighting mechanisms to select actions based on incoming signals of intention

Generator

:   The effector signal of one sub-agent feeds into the sensor signal of another and vice versa,
    thereby creating a generative loop and novel output which may be only loosly tied to the
    external context

Broadcaster (Router)

:   A 'mirror' subagent acts simultaneously as a conductor and executor. Shares messages with
    network after selectively performing some selection/mutation on the signals sent to it from the
    network.

    Note this configuration also creates a generator network between all connected agents

## Agency and Communication

Signals and Communication
:   Communication occurs through perceived signals, but not all signals are communication. All
    change creates signal, communication is signal who's structure infers the presence of subjective
    experience outside one's own.

Communication Functions
:   - Acquire inputs to feed into predictive models
    - Modify internal models
    - Share internal models
    - Express intention

Communication Mediums
:   - (In)Action: Real-time communication
      - Speech
      - Movement
    - Artifact: Asynchronous communication
      - Writing
      - Public Works
      - Style/Adornment
      - Technologies

Indirect Communication
:   Many forms of aggregate agency cannot be directly communicated with, and instead proxy
    communication must occur. E.g. one cannot communicate with a body politic, but one can
    communicate with representatives or its members. One cannot communicate with an ecosystem, but
    one can participate through planting, culling, and re-shaping the water patterns and topology.

Intention and Communication
:   Any agent is likely communicating with multiple purposes using multiple mediums
    simultaneously.

    Unintentional communication is in fact more likely than intentional communication, as
    communication is also a by-product of sustaining oneself and using energy.

Perceived Value versus Lived Values
:   By examining actions through the lens of communication, one can identify value-mismatches
    between what one perceives ones values to be and the values actually lived.

Dialogue
:   Generative agency is a special phenomenon that creates chaotic behavior and is therefore
    unpredictable. It is the phenomenon that populates the universe with life.

    Dialogue is when two agents communicate _within_ a structure of shared super-agency and
    iteratively express their internal models of that super-agent structure. By internalizing
    one another's message, they update the shared model of the super-agent, which both evolves their
    internal models, and changes their relationship with one another and the super-agent.

    Dialogue and Debate only occur when sub-minds agree on their shared super-agency. Dialogue and
    debate, when performed by members of a super-agency, and when attended by enough of the
    super-agency community results in an evolution of the community by performing a modification to
    the community's shared beliefs and contextual manifold.

    Such Dialogue and Debate updates internal representations of the superagent within the
    community. This can either identify internal inconsistencies within the community: thereby
    making it more effective at achieving its values, or evolve the communities understanding of
    what their shared superagency is: thereby changing the community's values.

    Only aggregate agents can have generative qualities, as dialogue is only possible among agents
    who share some common context.

    Only generative agents are inherently externally unpredictable. Simple agents can have random
    behavior, but generative agents can learn and create. Generative agency only can occur within an
    aggregate agent, for it involves the interplay between the internal models of two or more
    sub-agents feeding into one another in a recursive manner to generate new self-consistent values
    and intentions which then can be acted upon within objective reality.

Inferring Agency Through Observation of Communication Mediums
:   Identify means of information transfer, then hypothesize agency. Based on our model of agency, in
    order for an agent to exist, there must be a means to generate [value][]s, [intention][]s,
    [attention][], and [Sensory Input][]s. Each of these properties requires a means to store and
    mutate information, as well as translate from one property to the other.

Consciousness
:   Global Workspace Theory of Consciousness. Having "Conscious Access": We have conscious access to
    information if we can report that information to other people.

## Education

Play
:   Play is dialogue: an interchange of cause and counter cause between two models in the
    universe, play is a peer to peer activity.

Training
:   Training is a superagent to subagent relationship. It is unidirectional communication.  The
    intention is for the subagent to internalize a facet of the superagent's structure such that it
    can operate as a function of the collective, based on some input intention. This is what's
    happening when a learned skill becomes automatic: your conscious mind (aka multiple sub-minds
    working together) work to assess and internalize a new skill within one or more sub-minds. Once
    internalized those sub-minds can operate autonomously for the collective. A similar thing is
    happening at all levels of training. Training is fundamentally hierarchical, and involves some
    degree of subjugation (voluntary or otherwise).

Exploration
:   Exploration is a more intentional variant of play, this involves a rigorous exploration of a
    territory in order to internalize or update a model of some external phenomenon.

Coaching
:   A weird interplay between training and exploration. The intention is to help a student
    internalize something almost platonic in nature, through exploration of the facets of that form,
    acting as a guide for someone who is voluntarily manipulating their subjectivity to more closely
    reflect an idealized form (superagent).

Guided Exploration
:   Preparing an environment to play in, such that the learned models by the players are likely to
    mirror the intended models.


## Games, Environment and Agency

Environment (territory) shapes agency and vice versa

Games define an environment, and your agency, in terms of relationship to the environment as well as
relationship to other agents within that environment is shaped by the rules of the environment.

This lesson is one of defining context, within the nested space of animist agency, each agency is
located within a certain territory with its own topology and rules.
