# Practice


## Vision

Because it takes many repeated interactions to reliably infer a normative order, we propose a
normative tagging protocol as a type of accessibility aid for ourselves and our communities. This
protocol leverages advances in distributed network technology as well as cognitive science in order
to help us navigate our increasingly dynamic, inter-connected, pluralistic, and fragile world. We
believe our protocol enables each of us to be more open and engaged with one another without
suffering from the vulnerability we typically associate with such openness. Bringing our protocol
into cultural awareness will increase our opportunities for positive sum interaction. We believe
this protocol can simultaneously increase our freedom, opportunity, and security across society --
values which often conflict with one another. The protocol is the Animist Interface.

When our normative sense becomes salient, it provides a high signal to noise channel on which we can
directly engage with the *meaning* behind our actions. When we can directly engage with the meaning
of action, we increase our capacity to reliably chart a course into the present and future we want
to inhabit.

Examples of this direct meaning communication include:

1. *Internal coordination*: Living systems rely on differentiation and specialization to function
   effectively. Often we are unaware of what life we are constituent of, let alone what that life
   relies on us for. Normative tagging brings clarity in this relationship while maintaining the
   fluidity and nuance necessary to grow and adapt. This notion of what value we have to others
   gives us direct feedback on who we are *to* the world. It provides direct knowledge that we are
   in fact more than one self, we are composed of selves in a complex hierarchy of being. This type
   of coordination is most applicable to businesses and families.
1. *Internal negotiation*: Our selves are in a continual process of renewal and change. By
   understanding our normative orders, we can better understand who we are and what we want to
   become. With this knowledge we more likely access the communities and routines necessary to
   actualize the desired transformation. This type of communication is most applicable to
   self-actualization.
1. *External negotiation*: Through adoption of our proposed protocol, freedom can increase without
   sacrificing our shared stability or safety. Within the Animist Interface one is fully aware of
   one's negotiation position and better understand the position of the counterparty. In this
   scenario, often the most beneficial outcome for all parties is not a simple monetary transaction
   but rather a more durable or otherwise unique arrangement. Public broadcast of one's normative
   order enables parties to quickly find the maximal trust they can place in one another and
   leverage that trust to access the most durable mutually affording relationship. Currently, lack
   of normative understanding reduces our mutual trust and necessitates the need to reduce most
   interactions into the most common denominators: universal monetary systems and context
   insensitive systems of law and regulation. This type of communication is most applicable to
   re-imagining the governmental and economic arrangements which underpin most of current global
   society.

Much of the above capability derives from Animist Interface's ability to provide parties with ad hoc
protocols specific to the interaction surface between the normative orders in question. By reviewing
the parties normativity and current states, algorithmic protocols can recommend a coordination
strategy which brings most value to the parties while preserving and isolating their value
differences.

With even partial adoption, we predict this protocol to cause tangible changes to behavior and how
we communicate with one another. Examples include:

1. Bespoke recommendation systems based on your broadcast values. For example, news feeds customized
   to your context and normativity, thereby avoiding the [phantom limb][] phenomenon.
1. A more nuanced understanding of ones roles and responsibilities. A re-framing of work and
   play. No longer does there have to be a distinction between work and play, what matters is active
   participation in meaningful modes of being.
1. A more productive society, partially through a nuanced understanding of what productivity means,
   but also through objectively more productive outcomes. By clearly communicating and coordinating
   within and between ourselves, we can maximally reduce losses to our agency.
1. A common lexicon for inferring one's values and the values of others.
1. A common lexicon for identifying, isolating, and resolving value dissonance.
1. A common lexicon for relating one's actions to one's values.
1. Testable insights into the problems of consciousness and artificial intelligence alignment
   derived from the new reference frame available from our objective definition of normativity and
   normative inference theories.


## Solution Summary


We provide a preliminary design for a scalable network protocol which enables society to better
coordinate our shared pursuit of meaning. Our approach, The Animist Interface, acknowledges the
impossibility of starting from scratch. Our environment is the way it is, our culture and cognition
likewise. Nevertheless, iterative transformation is possible.

Our approach relies on two beliefs: 1) the Animist Interface can be applied to one problem domain at
a time and demonstrate tangible increases in personal agency and well being, and 2) the Animist
Interface can become a dramatically scalable network as it holds the promise of synergistically
improving the efficiency, resiliency, and meaning potential across the entire diversity of different
domains and different people.

Finally we offer our concluding thoughts and invite your participation. If you have made it this
far, we thank you. If you are inspired, please join us as we continue our journey. There's a long
road ahead, but we are sure to find some insight along the way.

In order to move this theory of meaning into application we need a framework capable of expressing
the agent:arena transjective relationship interpretable to human cognition and computational
processing. It needs the following characteristics:

- Direct applicability to typical life experience
- Enable us to transcend our biological agent:arena boundary, and make meaning in our ecological,
  technological, and cultural contexts.
- Perspective on how best to put such a model into practice in such a manner that does not involve
  destroying existing normative structures.
- A shared protocol for expressing worth, salience, grip, sacrifice
- The capacity to scale across our entire diversity of cognition: across our cognitive growth and
  lifecycles, across our ecological, technological, and social cognitive embodied realities.

## The Cognitive And Social Power Of Symbolism

Symbols as a holographic principle -- providing a multi-dimensional representation of the entire
breadth of the symbolic construct in both low and high data representations. High data simply adds
fidelity to the object. This aids in group coordination.

Symbols are communicated. Communication always performed through dimensionally constrained
medium. Symbolism, as embodied, is always higher dimensional than the mechanism of communication
channel. Thus, symbols can never be fully accurately communicated. Rather dialogue can "walk around"
the symbol, exploring facets one at a time. Then, through the "depth perception" of the mind, we can
reconstruct a more full expression of the symbol within the subjective experience.

Introduce the mythos.

## Symbolic Governance: or how to wisely communicate

The rubber hits the road when we are capable of:

- defining normative algorithms which are composable, and accurately reflect where a person "feels"
  they are
- See incentive and interest in maintaining discrete collective symbols
- See coordination using data and dialogue between different symbols and between different
  constellations on how to evolve.

## Meaning Metrics

Primary intention is to identify symptoms of meaninglessness in order to coordinate their reduction
or removal.

### The Agent

- potential agency holds infinite normative potential
- actual agency holds specific, but evolvable normativity
- consciousness provides the capacity to simulate alternative normative possibilities

### The Arena

- Define the stranger. That which lacks normativity and contains infinity
- the wellspring of potential, contains the unity, lacks the discrete
- culture as dialogos with the stranger
- emergence does not discount the stranger, but rather points to their mystery. Can still experience
  new wellsprings of potential from higher-order RR networks

Quantum mechanics as the initial dance? The initial coupling of infinite energy to
autopoietic/discriminator stability? If so, the question becomes information theoretic -- similar to
Nick Lane's work -- given infinite change, how would static structure propagate?

### Their Optimal Relationship

- the infinite game

- Agent must be wedded to the arena (percent cognitive capacity devoted to arena upkeep should not
  fall to zero)

- Agent must have free capacity in order to explore, which is necessary for transcendence

- Where an agent's capacity ratio falls is a function of their internal landscape, as well as the
  arena itself. The arena can be changed either through physical movement, or Inter-Agent "parental"
  relationships, which provide sustenance and safety to the agent in question.

- Agent must 'sacrifice' to the arena in order to preserve certain symbolic
  partnerships. inter-symbol parent relationships require sacrifice from both parties.

### Autopoiesis and Normativity

what is it to value? how does valuation work, what is ranking.

- Fundamentally normativity translates a sub-context into a (set of ) orderable metrics.
- sub-context itself may be composed or at least mappable to other orderable metrics. Symbolic
  normativity has some relationship with such sub contextual assessments.

#### The importance of a barrier

autopoiesis and normativity are not possible without a manifold.

autopoiesis is conservation of a certain structure within a manifold

normativity is a preferred direction of flow: a statement that information x should flow to this
side of the barrier.

Preferred direction of flow only makes sense with respect to an autopoietic entity, as such an
entity is the only type of information that attempts to preserve a set of informational properties
against a varied environment.

Should, ought, etc., are the root words of normativity. Deontology studies them
