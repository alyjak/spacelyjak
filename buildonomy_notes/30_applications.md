# Applications

*Proposed Application*

## Journal

Explicitly Identify and Track internal agency and values. Create a feedback mechanism to incorporate
external subagents into your agency.

> Journal
>
> Initially, AeSoP powers a Journaling App. This app organizes journaling routines around specific
> goals and tasks, allowing them to exist as part of one or many different abstraction
> hierarchies. This puts the day-to-day focus on journaling about what you did, and the day-to-day
> focus for tasks on what's achievable, while providing the necessary abstraction to connect and
> reflect on higher level goals and achievements through the work you put into with your day to day
> journal habit.

## Home Assistant interface

Home as an executor subagent, taking input from the inhabitants to determine output state.

## Property Assistant

bbiome: mapping property, modeling its capabilities to design, plan, and execute permaculture
inspired environments. Optimized for low maintenance, high biodiversity, and high nutrition output.

> Decolonize - A Permaculture/Homesteading IOT interface
>
> This is a game interface where you use your available capital (through commons processes, and
> property rights) to attempt to game a few metrics:
>
> - Self quantization of dependencies (These measures normalize your tracking performance against
>   aggregate measures (composed of your opted-in community data groups))
> - Supply chain length (in terms of intermediaries between yourself and the source producer of your
>   end goods)
> - Supply chain reseliency (In terms of producer options of end goods)
> - Performance of projects (These are community-based scoreboards of completion of community-based
>   procedure definitions)

TODO:


## Enterprise Compiler/Collator

Distributed Enterprise Design/Information Platform (wiki/jira/shareworks style)

aesop's main design ancestor.

evolve notes into automation

embed requirements in narrative

documents serve multiple purposes and context filters can show those purposes individually or
simultaneously

Ideally use one straight forward content generation purpose to satisfy multiple contextual needs


## Interface to collect and share personal information with trusted parties

- Better identify what purpose our information is intendedfor
- track our information as it moves through databases
- batching and approval process for information, allowing us to have a more explicit transaction
- site access based on data tokens mediated by above

## Rediscovering ancient resource allocation protocols: longhouses and bartering

Share our stuff

- Have trusted network of agents who share inventory knowledge
- have trusted method of accessing shared inventory
- have explicit obligations by parties for working on the level of social debts instead of monetary
  debts

## Investing Daemons

AeSop could be an interesting way of doing partially automated trading. Use it to categorize and
filter prospects, then set up price and news scanning to produce alerts.

## Group Bonding

Create time windows where a (voice only?) telecon automatically opens on a certain schedule such
that you can share rituals within a geographically distributed tight-knit group such as a family.
