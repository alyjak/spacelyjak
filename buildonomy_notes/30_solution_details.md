## A draft procedure: Developing Incremental Living Symbology

1. translate existing problem into a symbolic representation. Is the problem composed of trying to
   define one symbol? Is it a coordination problem between multiple symbols?

1. For each symbol:

   - what symbols tie it to reality. What are its dependencies
   - what is it's normative value
   - who depends on it

1. For the coordination

   - What's the communication medium. Is it point to point, broadcast, or a mix (local broadcast)?

   - Is this peer to peer communication? If so, what is the coordination intent? Are the peers a
     collective or acting as independent entities?

     1. If independent, channel protocol needs to see a market exchange. Protocol governance
        (normative value) is about market-driven fairness.
     1. If a collective, normative value and responsibility must be distributed fairly.

1. Why this helps:

   1. Modularize any problem into a coordination problem, where a governance structure can be set up
     to further define each piece of the puzzle.
   1. Each governance piece is set up for.

      - Universal scaling (Personal execution context, universal governance)
      - Automous deployment
      - Discriminating vs. Universal metrics can be assessed at any level of any hierarchy. This
        provides good heuristics on the actual normative potential from any symbol as well as the
        relative risk from harnessing that potential

   1. Map out a highly complex problem domain, easily mixing levels of abstraction, different
      domains, etc., and uncover how much you know and don't know about the interaction space and
      the overall intentions (if any). Measure meaning loss/gain at each juncture in the
      mapping. Find the self-organizing systems.

1. Mechanisms of Action:

   - Attention Cultivation and Augmentation
   - Expertise Cultivation and Augmentation
   - Resource Distribution
   - Contextual Sensitivity and Valence Processing
