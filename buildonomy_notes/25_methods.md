# The Animist Interface

## From Framework to Methods

The Animist Interface as a framework is the concept that the quality of my subjective environment
improves when I map all my sense-data and actions to relational models of agency. Determining how to
do this is the topic of this section. To start operating within this framework, I must learn to
think within the language of the framework. Fortunately, The Animist Interface can be adopted
piecemeal. I can identify some particular phenomenon within my subjective environment I am having
trouble relating to, then start to apply the Animist Interface methods to just that domain. As I
practice, it becomes more and more natural to re-frame my relationships and I start to use these
methods without as much conscious effort.

These methods are intended to be learned, but also integrated into technology such as cell phones,
home automation, and web sites which I interact with on a daily basis. By "installing" The Animist
Interface in my "wetware" as well as in the information technology within my contextual environment,
I can more effectively extend the reach and quality of my agency, thereby improving my capacity to
bring harmony between my values and objective reality.

## It All Starts With Communicating Context

Every embodied agent is defined by their unique context. Among other factors, an agent's context
includes their physical location, personal history, means of communication and sensing, and where
they direct their attention. By becoming more skilled at defining and manipulating our context, we
can better express to ourselves and our peers both who we are and what our intentions
are. Expressing context clearly requires a shared language that allows us to be simultaneously
accurate, precise, and succinct when trying to describe elements of our own, or another's personal
context.

This requires some shared vocabulary which we can employ to describe context at various levels of
detail. In order to integrate with our peers and technology, this language must be machine parsable
as well as naturally fit within human speech.

It doesn't require action, descriptions of context should be static. It does require abstraction,
where elements of context can be built up in limitless layers. It's natural form is a lattice. That
implies there is a layer of base concepts upon which abstract concepts are generated. For the
contextual lattice to be interpretable and inferrable by support software, we need some common
vocabulary for this base.

By creating layers of abstraction on top of the basic atoms of context, we can start to map out
similarity groups between separate entities, clustering them in order to describe collective
intentions and values and encapsulate that understanding in defining a super agent structure.

Context maps an entity onto a territory. Each territory has a predefined spacial structure. Using a
dependency chain of territory definitions, higher order types define new territories by mapping
regions of their dependencies into a new territory definition.

What territories are visible to an agent depends on what higher order types they initialize.

## Understanding and Encapsulating Context through Agency

### Know Thyself

Map your territory in order to describe the contextual details of what makes your identity. For
every element, try to name at least one agent (human, internal-subagent, cultural agent,
environmental agent or otherwise) which shares that contextual element with you.

- identify values: what are the optimization metrics?
- identify context: what are the details of life that cannot be ignored and form the water in which
  you swim?
- divide values: what values are coherent?
- what context is specific for understanding your value-sets
- grow thyself, optimizing for continual learning and growth

### Inferring and Modeling the Presence of Aggregate Agents

(Remove? I like the approach of creating a lexicon of atomic context, then create an ontology of
relationships where plugins capture subsets of that data to define higher order types. The higher
order types then define different types of sub/super agency.

Atomic contextual information will be unreliable, so the presence of higher order types will require
a certain amount of inference and bootstrapping.

Finding Agent Boundaries

- Identify a potential Subjective Manifold: sense and effect with information conduits all 'pointed'
  in the closed direction.
- 2nd order: intention and attention, observe environment over time, modeling what information is
  available from sensors, and what they are paying attention to from that stream.
- 3rd order: decomposition into sub and super agents. Super agency can make intention very hard to
  infer (e.g. ants sacrificing themselves to build a bridge for other ants to cross).


Identifying a Sub or Super Agent

- Propose a shared context, this is the information stream which the sub-agents coordinate through
- Identify multiple potential sub-agents, form hypothesis about how they will act given certain
  shared context information.
- Identify which sub-agents are privileged and have write access to (aspects of) the shared context.


Inferring An Agent's Characteristics (goals/values/intention/attention)

- Classification into negotiating posture. Some types of agency are non-negotiable (physical forces
  for example). Some types of agency are only negotiable as part of a collective (e.g. nation
  states)
- alignment with self

## Navigating Relationships

When working together as a collective one must simultaneously differentiate and homogenize. Internal
cohesion requires a shared understanding of distributed responsibilities, external success requires
common purpose and common narrative. Mental offloading through coordinated responsibilities.

Relationships all have two sides, it's important to understand what relationships you are actively
participating in, and what side you are on (or should be on) in that relationship.

- recruit <-> integrate into
- teach to <-> learn from
- delegate <-> take orders
- grow <-> shrink
- aid <-> isolate (legitimize <-> delegitimize)
- representation <-> collective decision making
- internally differentiate <-> externally unify
- steward/host <-> guest

Interacting With Aggregate Agents

- Treat as a single entity or as a community?
- Important to note which agents have functional control of effector channels.
- If communicating with a representative of a super-agency, note this may create internal politics
  within the aggregate agent if the aggregate is threatened or if the sub-agent is put in a privileged
  position through the communication.

Internal conflict

- How to wisely navigate membership within multiple super-agents with mutually conflicting values

## Predicting Changes in Agency Due to Changes in Environment

This type of analysis can help predict the consequences when agency is displaced, or an environment
is perturbed, such as through introduction of new technology or a cataclysm.

The environment an agent is embedded within causes one or more effects on agency. It affects agency
through:

- modifying input data
- modifying means of control, effector
- modifying intention
- modifying attention
- modifying internal models/predictive capacity
