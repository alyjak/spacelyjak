Future Focused Government
#########################

I believe that one of the principle roles of effective government is to protect
and grow our common future. I believe progressive parties are the closest
political affiliation for sharing this belief with me.

Breaking this down, a few key points emerge that need to be addressed.

#. Progress involves change, and change is inherently risky because political
   change cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.

   This implies that rolling out a political change should be done with a lot of
   supporting evidence, or with other approaches like minimizing the impact of
   change by limiting the extent of the roll-out (only roll out to local
   governments). Also, change should require a roll-back plan. Similar to what's
   done with critical software

#. The future involves unpredictable catastrophic events and abject
   sociopolitical failure must be considered a real possibility.

   This implies that states can fail. Since failure can propagate, and state
   failures have predictable consequences, this means that there must be a
   common means to identify and deal with failed states in order to ensure, in
   order of priority: 1) The failure does not propagate to neighboring states or
   localities, 2) The basic human rights of the constituents of the failed state
   are protected as much as possible, 3) The failed state is stabilized and
   given the resources to reach a minimum level of working governance as quickly
   as possible

#. Predicting the future is filled with uncertainty and requires expertise

   This point has potentially drastic impacts to how we elect and evaluate our
   federal appointees. This needs much more thought.


Both of these points have a correlary that aids in the implementation of
effective governance that can handle these points -- state size should be
minimized, as this helps to contain the risk of failure.
