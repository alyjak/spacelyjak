Harness Your Digital Presence
#############################

Digital applications just treat humans as consumers. The application
is designed to funnel interaction into a specific domain. It is in the
application's best interest to put of strong 'walls' around its
environment. This is because:

1. Interactivity at web-scale is hard
1. By funneling users into specific interaction points, their behavior
   can be predictably monetized.

What I believe is missing, is a digital harness, that allows digital
citizens to treat digital content as goods and resources, not as
locations or lifestyle choices.

What I imagine is a rethinking of the following tools:

1. email
1. rss feed
1. browser bookmarks
1. attribution
1. Ad blocker
1. data monetization

Web interactions should basically go through a clearinghouse, akin to
email, but more tuned for digital data filtration. This clearinghouse
lets us do a few things

1. Regular web browsing. Your web interactions get sucked into the
   app, they are blocked from 3rd party sites
1. Through a job you configure, your data can be filtered, packaged,
   and sent to those organizations you have a data agreement with
1. Comments, shares, bookmarks, etc. are part of this
   package. Comments and web interaction don't go directly to the
   site, instead they work through your clearinghouse. You can share
   your interactions with the site owner, your friends, etc. This type
   of data effectivly works as an overlay on top the site itself.

   When your friends etc. share, their information is part of your
   overlay as well. This makes web sites locations, where the
   experience a function of both the site's programming as well as
   your own context. Basically your friends become priveleged
   advertisers on within your digital environment
1. Sharing these data packages creates hooks into that fabric that you
   are interacting with. This becomes an organic rss feed, where
   updates
