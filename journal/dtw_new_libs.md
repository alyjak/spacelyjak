Looks like it's me and Tommy, we'll try and be quick

Tommy: talking about Detroit YIMBY: YIMBY Action, on September 13th there's a happy hour in Royal
Oak at Jolly Pumpkin. Have to join the org in order to get the info maybe?

Tommy, Sarah, and Charley (the county commissioner) are leading it. Having a meeting to decide what
they're going to get out of it.

## 2023-04-10

Attendance: John Kruse and David Rossie

Talked about Committee letter writing campaign. See reMarkable notes



## 2023-03-13

Dane DuFour and David Rossie attend.


- Is there an existing off the shelf proposed state law change that would enable Detroit to adopt
  split tax? If not, we should get that written
- Talked extensively about split tax, what is it, why does Detroit need it, who in the nation does
  it (not really anyone), what is needed at the state level.
- Talked about what is incentivizing home buying. People value the single family residential because
  that's what we've all grown up with as "what's valuable". We need to influence more people's
  aesthetics in order to help push to more desireable development patterns.
- People value walking in a "theme park mentality", they like to drive into walkable interesting
  places, not live there. -David
- David is excited about cherry hill, wishes more developers started projects like that.
- I was griping about how we aren't set up to do much. David reminds us there's value in connecting,
  even if we don't make tangible progress
- zoom was advertising it at 8:30, make sure are advertising meeting at 9.
- David might run the letter by the Plymouth mayor, give us some insight.


## 2023-02-15 DTW New Libs meeting

Introductions

- Attendance: Andrew Lyjak (Plymouth), Louis Birach (Detroit), Charlie Starkman (Farmington Hills),
  Zane DuFour (royal Oak), Mark (Wixom)
- Coordinate our outreach: What organizations can we commit to working with?
  I briefed on the orgs I'm starting to get in contact with
- Initiate a letter writing campaign, review Markâ€™s draft
  Most of the meeting revolved around setting our priorities via Marks policy bullet points
- Roundtable on Chapter Priorities
  See above
- Vote on our March in person event
  Interest in having something sooner rather than later
- General Discussion
  Not much time

Chronological Notes:

- Discord invite expired, plug this one in next email: https://discord.gg/CPtRFMKR7e
- sent a Rw link to the chat for the YIMBY letter
- Talking about split tax likilihood

   - Tate wants to get split tax onto the state docket
   - MASQ asks, are there supermajority requirements for any votes at the state level? No, only
     simple majorities
- Going through the 6 bullet points

  - Andrew: top 3 is split tax, ADU, and enable mixed use
  - Louis would replace mixed use with enable pedestrian mobility: There's a lot of federal $$ on that
  - Charlie: Seconds the replacement of mixed use with pedestrian mobility
  - Zane: One benefit going for ADUs at the state level is the simplicity of the legislation. Ending
    parking minimums has the worst vibes. Thirds replacement of mixed use with the ped
  - Mark: Understands the mixed use is extremely complicated. To address one point of Louis' yes it
    is currently a local decision, but the state can preempt them. Concern with the pedestrian
    mobility stuff is messaging it to republicans
  - Andrew: re the messaging mobility to republicans: yes but we can chose which localities we
    message to.
  - Re zoning: states can give and they can take away zoning authority, so statewide is still a
  - Re mobility: there's a letter writing campaign to municipalities to ensure they are fully aware
    of $$ opportunities from fed. e.g. Fed priorities:
    https://grist.org/transportation/biden-administration-unveils-roadmap-for-a-greener-more-equitable-transportation-sector/

    - There's a problem with gunning for pedestrian mobility about minimum density to make work, so
      we have to pick our municipalities judiciously

    - Louis throws in the data! List of michigan cities by density:
      http://www.usa.com/rank/michigan-state--population-density--city-rank.htm

    - Zane: Re split rate tax system: talked to his reps, neither knew about the split rate tax
      system. The thing that was surprising was her staff member who was very into YIMBY tax stuff
      but wasn't aware of it.

- In person meeting: Mark has every other weekend availability.

    - What type of venue? Beer over coffee seems to be the consensus

## Where We Want This Chapter To Go

- Von. Expand? Be civil. Tired of arguing with people on what Neolib means
- Kareem. Whats really important is who's getting elected at city councils and state
  offices. Working at helping local Dem clubs. I (alyjak), riff on this and give my notion of being
  a support group that ties us with common values together. 
- Charley: since he's involved in my city and state party. Lets us know that these local Dem groups
  leave time for specialist groups to have time. This is a way we can get our message out.
- Ryan: Sounds good, David mentioned YIMBYism, he agrees. Mentions detroit parking minimums, zoning.

   - Kareem seconds this. Transit is where it is

- Zane: Likes Von's point of being a big tent. Our DTW big tent is going to be different than LA or
  SF. Likes the idea of participating in Local Politics, going to meetings etc, not necessarily
  running. It all feels opaque, having a group like this helps on figuring on what to focus on. Even
  things like knowing about the. He's concerned about where to put his energy. Close by, or
  somewhere that needs more 'help'.

  - Charley mentions to Zane that Farmington Hills is one of the few townships that haven't opted in
    to open dispensaries. Even in an area that's "blue" the city council might have a conservative
    lean.

  - Zane: Bike infrastructure is really important.

- David: Knows the mayor of Plymouth. Wants single family zoning gone. There's some rezoning going
  on at the margins that's good. Not a lot of ideas of what we want the group to be, but want to see
  it grow. Inspired by what's going on in A2.

## My thoughts, trying to summarize it

- support group, yes
- have a message every year

  - David mentions smart growth
  - 
## Newsletter Copy

Welcome to the DTW New Liberal News! This is intended as a way to pass out meeting notes from our
gatherings as well as share any interesting news from the metro that we might want to get involved
in. You can expect a new edition of the newsletter every month after our chapter meeting. Admittedly
my ambition has a way of surpassing my motivation, but with your help we can keep this up and
running!  Let me know on our Discord of any stories you want to share with the chapter, as well as
any other feedback you have on the newsletter and I'll roll in your suggestion in the next edition.

### TLDR;

* Fill out the February meeting Doodle
* We're poised for success!
* Join the Discord!
* Join the Calendar!

### Meeting Summary

Thank you all who attended our inaugural 2023 meeting! I can already tell we have the potential to
positively impact our metro. We share a common vision. We have a breadth of expertise and
perspectives. We're spread out just enough to know what's happening across the entire region but
close enough that we can all meet in-person when the need is there. During the meeting we introduced
ourselves and discussed what we want to do with the chapter. Nothing is decided yet but I feel
confident that we're selecting from a limited range of options -- not the entire space of all policy
and chapter goals.

Our common interests (seem to) include:

- Using the group as a support group to stay involved in local policy and politics. This way we can
  avoid our worst tendancies to 'armchair politics'. Lets limit the social media drama and maximize
  our positive impact! If this point resonates with you and you want to get some ideas, here's a
  book suggestion: [Politics is for Power, by Eitan
  Hersh](https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Power-Beyond-Political-Hobbyism/dp/1982116781)
- Zoning and Transportation. I think we can learn a lot on how to be effective activists on this
  front from the [Strong Towns](https://www.strongtowns.org/) and [Smart Growth
  America](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/) Organizations.
- Influencing local democratic chapters to support pragmatic candidates and not ones who pull the
  party radically left.

Unfortunately we ran out of time to complete our dialogue on these topic areas. What I propose we do
is hold our February meeting in approximately two weeks so that we can solidify our chapter's
priorities. I propose we all get some homework. **For our next meeting, please come prepared with:**

1. A commitment to participate in some sort of local governance; this could be participating in your
   local Democratic or Republican chapter, or attending local township/city council meetings.
2. A (relatively) concrete proposal for a policy position you would like to see our chapter adopt
   and champion.

Finally, if/when we see our chapter grow we're going to need to have a more stable governance
structure than we currently have. I propose we have at least the following separate chairs:

**Social Media Rep:** Responsible for pushing content using the @detroitneolib twitter account, as
well as sending out reminder emails

**EmCee:** Schedule and Lead chapter meetings. Main point of contact for chapter related questions
and concerns.

We also need to figure out how we decide things, like our shared policy priorities. We can either
set up a Discord poll bot for this, or take votes at the meeting itself.

In the future I hope to include a local news section, but I ain't got any local news to share, so
that's it for today!


## Markose meeting 1/30/2023

- Schedule something larger in-person for March.

- GET INVOLVED WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

  - Detroit YIMBY, Transit, LVT, RTA, host events with them

### Personal Thoughts

- Create 'stories to pay attention to' list

- Create bot to pay attention to those lists?
- Create 'events to plan' list
